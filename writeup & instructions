	#WriteUp
	
The big O of the loop that I have written for counting nucleotides is O(n) i.e. linearly complex.
The estimated execution time is 48 seconds and the percentage of GC content is 20% for each of these.

	#Instructions

1.	To compile the program you need to open a terminal in the same folder as the program and type "make" 
	then press enter
	
2.	To run the program with the filename and flag as input arguments, you can use the following command:
	./main <filename> <flag>
	
3.	The flags are "a" or "A" will run the sub-problem A of Question 2 while the flag "b" or "B" will 
	execute the sub-problem B of the given question.

4.	For Example: ./main human.txt B
